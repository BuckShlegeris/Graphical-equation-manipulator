TODO

- Finish an equation renderer, integrate that with my code

- Make the code packageable

- Save, open

- Add the cool triangle thing

- Add differentiation

- Fix my uncertainties module wrt powers

- Make numerical constants

- Numerical input with units

- Fix right click menus, including for the equation (it says you can add numerical values)

Done:

- Uncertainties!!!
- Add numerical values
- You should be able to drag from an equation to a variable in an expression  and have that rewrite, which is just the opposite of the current way of doing it
- Write my own uncertainties module
