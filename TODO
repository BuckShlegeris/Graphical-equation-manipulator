TODO

- Make the code packageable
- Save, open
- Fix my uncertainties module wrt powers etc.
	This mostly just involves implementing the direct partial derivative method.
- Make numerical constants
- Numerical input with units
- Fix right click menus, including for the equation (it says you can add numerical values)
- Equate variables in the same equation
- Show a warning message when an inappropriate approximation is made (eg using non-relativistic kinetic energy when the numerical value for velocity is too high.)
- Make typing v=40 work
- Plus/minus
- When you click on a thing, a printable version gets put in your text viewy bit

Done:

- Uncertainties!!!
- Add numerical values
- You should be able to drag from an equation to a variable in an expression  and have that rewrite, which is just the opposite of the current way of doing it
- Write my own uncertainties module

Wishlist:

Rewrite it as a web app in Javascript and HTML5.
- Add the cool triangle thing
- Add differentiation
- Finish an equation renderer, integrate that with my code
