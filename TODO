TODO

Add a little bit of usability to the CLI -- maybe it could do something better than crashing if you mess up

Enforce the restriction that a variable only appears in one formula

Document the assumptions I'm making in simpleSolver.py

Add dimensional analysis

Look for easy ways to add more functionality to the solver -- addition would be nice.

Add the ability to give numerical values to variables.
