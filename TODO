TODO

- Finish an equation renderer, integrate that with my code
- Make the code packageable
- Save, open
- Fix my uncertainties module wrt powers etc.
	This mostly just involves implementing the direct partial derivative method.
- Make numerical constants
- Numerical input with units
- Fix right click menus, including for the equation (it says you can add numerical values)
- Equate variables in the same equation
- Add the cool triangle thing
- Add differentiation

Done:

- Uncertainties!!!
- Add numerical values
- You should be able to drag from an equation to a variable in an expression  and have that rewrite, which is just the opposite of the current way of doing it
- Write my own uncertainties module
