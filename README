----README----

This is the very first draft of my equation manipulator. It solves equations
sometimes. Currently, it's limited to equations which are the product of 
variables to various powers and a constant. Usage is via a crappy command
line interface.

I plan to use this version as a stepping stone for later versions.


----Simple CLI example----

Here's a sample session with the CLI, solving the age old problem of how fast an
object will hit the ground given the height at which it started falling.

>> add equation PE = m2 g h

Equations:
Equation 0:  KE = 0.5 m1 v^2
Equation 1:  PE = m2 g h

>> declare equal m1 m2

Equations:
Equation 0:  KE = 0.5 m1 v^2
Equation 1:  PE = m2 g h

Equivalencies:
m1=m2

No rewrites

>> declare equal KE PE

Equations:
Equation 0:  KE = 0.5 m1 v^2
Equation 1:  PE = m2 g h

Equivalencies:
m1=m2
KE=PE

No rewrites

>> rewrite v

Equations:
Equation 0:  KE = 0.5 m1 v^2
Equation 1:  PE = m2 g h

Equivalencies:
m1=m2
KE=PE

Rewrites:
v  =  0.707106781187 m1^(-1/2) KE^(1/2)

>> restate v without KE using 1

Equations:
Equation 0:  KE = 0.5 m1 v^2
Equation 1:  PE = m2 g h

Equivalencies:
m1=m2
KE=PE

Rewrites:
v  =  0.707106781187 h^(1/2) g^(1/2)
