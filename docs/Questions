Questions:

Test version 1:

1. 
	- I slide a brick down an infinitely slippery slide. The slide is 10m tall. How fast is the brick going when it gets to the bottom?
	- I have a bucket of water which is 27 degrees. How high would I have to lift it to give it potential energy equivalent to the energy it would take to heat it to 100 degrees?
	- A pole vaulter is running along at 7ms^-1, then launches herself into the air. How far can her center of mass rise into the air?

2. Previous, with uncertainty.

3. 
	- How fast is Mars rotating around the Sun, in terms of G, its radius of rotation, and the mass of the sun?
	- ???

See how fast they are, how accurate.

They can have the formula sheet for uncertainties, and the Phys1101 formula sheet.

How do I decide which questions they do? Do they go with and without GEM?
