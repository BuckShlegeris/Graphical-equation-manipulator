Questions:

Test version 1:

1. I slide a brick down an infinitely slippery slide. The slide is 10m tall. How fast is the brick going when it gets to the bottom?

2. If the slide was 10+-1m tall, what's the velocity of the brick including its uncertainty?

4. How fast is Mars rotating around the Sun, in terms of G and its radius of rotation?

Test version 2:

1. I have a bucket of water which is 27 degrees. How high would I have to lift it to give it potential energy equivalent to the energy it would take to heat it to 100 degrees?

2. If the original temperature of the water is 27+-2 degrees, what's that height including its uncertainty?

4. How fast is Mars rotating around the Sun, in terms of G and its radius of rotation?
